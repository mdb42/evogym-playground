# Looking for Partner - Neuroevolution for Soft Robotics (EvolutionGym)

Hi all! I still need to find a partner. I don't know anyone in this class. If you took IR or applied stats last semester, I was the guy near the front who talked too much. If you took game development when Dr. Shade was still here, I was the guy who made your lab videos.

I'm definitely pursuing neuroevolution toward control systems for soft robotics with EvoGym. I have functioning boilerplate already to support experiments. I'm ready to start implementation on NEAT and soon HyperNEAT. I am ready to draft the proposal too, but if we're going to be working with partners, I would like to communicate first before I finalize my approach. My current plans are to test controllers under conditions of morphological degradation (simulating wear/damage over time). I'm confident we can get NEAT, HyperNEAT, and a degradation framework in place before the summer is out. If we have time, I'd like to examine using the CPPNs from HyperNEAT to generate CPG networks with Matsuoka oscillators. I have a fresh 5060, and I'm planning around a week-long training run.

I'm really happy to work with anyone who still needs a partner. Feel free to reply here or send me an email.

Cheers,
Matthew
